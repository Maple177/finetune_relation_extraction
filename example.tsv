10064839.T56.T49	Binding of dimemorfan to @GENE$ and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with @CHEMICAL$ and dextrorphan.	false
10064839.T50.T56	Binding of @CHEMICAL$ to @GENE$ and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan.	false
10064839.T56.T51	Binding of dimemorfan to @GENE$ and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and @CHEMICAL$.	false
10064839.T40.T52	This study therefore characterized the binding of @CHEMICAL$ to the sigma receptors and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR. We found that DF, DM, and DR were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (Ki=151, 205, 144 nM, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at @GENE$ (Ki=4-11 microM).	false
10064839.T40.T54	This study therefore characterized the binding of @CHEMICAL$ to the @GENE$ and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR. We found that DF, DM, and DR were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (Ki=151, 205, 144 nM, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at sigma-2 receptors (Ki=4-11 microM).	false
